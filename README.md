# Responsive Portfolio
Second week's homework for UNH Coding Boot Camp

Description
The goal of this project was to create a portfolio for our projects going forward that also functioned as a responsive web page. Our six main tasks were to ensure that:

The portfolio included our name, a photo, and links to sections about us, our work, and how to contact us.

All the links in the nav bar successfully scrolled down the page to the corresponding section.

The works section of this page comprises links to resume for ref to previos work experinces.

The image for the first project is larger than the others.

The page has a responsive layout that changes when viewed on different size screens.
